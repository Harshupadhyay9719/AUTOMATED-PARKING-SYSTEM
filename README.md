# AUTOMATED-PARKING-SYSTEM
A parking system in which no human is involved ."TOTALLY AUTOMATIC"
in this first off all i have used motion detection due to change in frame of video, using OPENCV
after that image capture and number plate recognition using EASY OCR 
after that i have used logic to identify vehicle number is valid or not 
then i have used SQL to store number plate and time of entry and exit
i also used text to speech for making it more reliable
